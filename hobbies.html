<h2 style="font-size: 25px; font-family: Arial black; color: white; text-align: center;"><strong>       One of my hobbies is the basketball. When i was a kid, my friends also playing basketball. Everyday, my friends always playing basketball. So many times I see them. So one day, when I'm watching TV, I see the one of the greatest player in NBA (NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION), that is LeBron James. I see his skills and i believe them. So one day, i buy a ball because i want to learn playing basketball. That's why i love playing basketball. </strong><h2>
